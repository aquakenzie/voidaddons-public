# VoidAddons

**VoidAddons** was an attempt to backdoor the VoidSMP minecraft server back in August 2023. Available features are found in SPOON.md, a "working" heatmap script and discord frontend are in `scripts/`.

Other than the backdoor, this plugin tracks admins in vanish (+/- 2), and adds a "trophy" system (idk i didnt work on it, fishy did)
